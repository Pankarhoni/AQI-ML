# Air Quality Prediction System

The Air Quality Prediction System is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts air quality based on pollutants such as SO2, NO2, RSPM, and SPM. 
This project showcases the implementation of a Random Forest model for air quality prediction using Flask, providing an interactive web interface for users to input data and receive predictions.
Used Jupyter Notebook  for analyzing the dataset with several Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.

The platform allows users to enter air pollutant levels, and the trained model will provide a prediction for the AQI, demonstrating the power of machine learning in environmental monitoring.
